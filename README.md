# Webdev_with_django

In this project, I am mostly focusing on the back-end part of the web development process.
I am using Django with python to create database modules, views, render templates, and URL routing.
This project contains a user interface where a user can log in to their profiles. They can create, update, read and delete their own projects.
Users can search for all the projects that are created by other users. They can also give feedbacks on projects created by other users. 

Project app:

This app contains the projects created by users. A project contains the title, user who created the project, tags (tools used in the project), 
Description of project, Photos, and feedback. Users can view a project and give feedback if they want.



Users app:

This app contains the required information of a user's profile like Name, About, Email, User status, and Photos.
A user can signup or log in. A user can have multiple projects. 



The front-end templates are used from a course by Dannis Ivy. This project still needs some parts to finish. I am still working on them.
